# Freelancer Landing Page

A minimal, responsive static landing page for a freelancer portfolio. This repository contains a single-page HTML site with styles and a hero image. It's intended as a lightweight starter you can customize and deploy quickly (for example on GitHub Pages).

## Quick Start

- Preview locally: open `index.html` in your browser or run a simple static server (see `docs/USAGE.md`).
- Customize: edit files in `css/` and replace images in `img/`.

## What You'll Find

- `index.html` — the main landing page markup.
- `css/normalize.css` — minimal reset/normalize stylesheet.
- `css/styles.css` — project styles and responsive rules.
- `img/hero.jpg` — hero/banner image used on the page.

## Features

- Small, dependency-free static site.
- Responsive layout suitable for mobile and desktop.
- Simple file structure for easy customization.

## Development & Preview

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser for a quick look.
2. To run a local HTTP server (recommended), from the project root run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Customizing

- Change copy and structure in `index.html`.
- Edit colors, spacing, and responsive breakpoints in `css/styles.css`.
- Replace `img/hero.jpg` with your own image (keep aspect ratio or update CSS).

## Deployment

- GitHub Pages: push to a repository and enable Pages from the `main` or `gh-pages` branch.
- Any static host (Netlify, Vercel, Surge) will work — just point it to this repository.
